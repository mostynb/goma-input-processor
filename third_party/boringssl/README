Files in this directory are a subset of chromium's third_party/boringssl.
However, to follow the latest BoringSSL, these are not just copy of the
files.

To update files in directory,
1. please bump-up commit in ../DEPS,
2. and run "python src/util/generate_build_files.py chromium"

Since we do not need to build mac-x86 and linux-arm, we just ignores to add
them even if such directories are made by the script.
