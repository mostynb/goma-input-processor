  <h1>The meaning of colors in finished tasks</h1>

<p>compiler_proxy's console (<a href="http://localhost:8088/">http://localhost:8088/</a>) shows finished tasks with several colors:

  <ul>
    <li><span class="task-status-success">Succeeded</span>:
      The task has run in a backend server and it succeeded
    <li><span class="task-status-cachehit">Cache hit</span>:
      Goma reused cached result
    <li><span class="task-status-local-cachehit">Local Cache hit</span>:
      Goma reused local cached result

    <li><span class="task-status-local-fallback">Local fallback</span>:
      The task finished locally. This happens when
      1) the local command finishes before Goma respond or
      2) Goma decided to run the task locally (e.g., for preprocess and link,
      Goma doesn't use its backends)
    <li><span class="task-status-retry">Retry</span>:
      The first request failed but the retried request succeeded.
      compiler_proxy remembers files it has already sent to backends and
      doesn't send them again. This status can happen Goma's backends
      don't have some of these files actually, due to cache expiration.
      You should be able to consider this state as success unless you see many
      (like >30%).
    <li>
      <span class="task-status-client-error">Client Error</span>*:
      There was an error in the part of the build execution on the Goma client
      (compiler_proxy). This could be due to a failure in a local build.
    <li>
      <span class="task-status-http-error">HTTP Error</span>*:
      There was an error trying to communicate with the Goma backend server over
      HTTPS. This could be due to an unhealthy or otherwise unresponsive backend
      server.
    <li>
      <span class="task-status-backend-error">Backend Error</span>*:
      Something wrong has happened in Goma's backends. Several reasons can
      cause this:
      <ol>
        <li>this type of request isn't supported by Goma yet
        <li>Goma's bug
        <li>cache expiration, etc.
      </ol>
    <li><span class="task-status-failure">Failed</span>
      Local task failed. Usually, this means your source code has some errors.
      If you are sure your source code is OK, this may indicate a serious bug
      in Goma. Please let us know.

    <li><span class="task-status-conftestfailure">Failed but
        maybe during ./configure</span>:
      Same as above but the input filename contains "conftest" so this may
      happened during ./configure.

    <li><span class="task-status-mismatch">Mismatch</span>:
      compiler version, compiler hash, or subprogram (e.g. .so files that
      a compiler uses) is mismatched between client and server.
      It means, the Goma server didn't use the same compiler as the compiler
      you used in your client, maybe because the Goma server doesn't have
      the same compiler.
   <li><span class="task-status-cancel">Canceled</span>:
     Goma canceled this task. This should happen only when you stopped
     your build (e.g., SIGINT for make).
  </ul>

* compiler_proxy will run local fallback whenever this
happens and your compilation should succeed. You may be able to ignore these
failures unless a lot of tasks are going to this state. When many tasks fail due
to this reason, Goma's performance can be significantly worse than usual.</p>
